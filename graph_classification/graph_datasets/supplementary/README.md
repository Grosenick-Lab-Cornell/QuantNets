These cover the supplementary, exploratory studies we perform to profile the sensitivities of our methods (QGCN and QGRN) to various parameters.

Similar to all run_experiment*.py files, the same flags (as outlined in the main README.md at root) can be used to further profile the models

**NOTES**:
- When running scripts here, you can pass in either custom/all to the flag - `--dataset`
- All downloaded datasets are also organized into the <root>/Datasets/RawGraph/* directory
- All results generated in this directory are populated into the <root>/Experiments/* directory
