Python scripts located in this directory are for generating primary (tabulated results in the main paper)

These cover only the graph dataset classification results tabulated in the manuscript

**NOTE**:
* Only a subset of the results were added into the main paper due to space constraints
* The main README.md at the root of the project spells out how to run these scripts with various flags to generate the rest of the results we shared, i.e., parameters table and wall-clock runtimes

All downloaded datasets are also organized into the <root>/Datasets/RawGraph/* directory
All results generated in this directory are populated into the <root>/Experiments/* directory
